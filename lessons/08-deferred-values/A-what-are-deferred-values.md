What happens if you have expensive (i.e. computationally difficult) components that need to re-render frequently? If you don't do something about it, it'll cause the infamous bad actor of frontend UIs: the dreaded **JANK** ðŸ‘»

So how can we handle this? You have a UI that's getting all sorts of new input and we need to re-render at _some_ interval, but it'd be great if we could slow it down a bit so we don't get a janky UI - we just slow down the parts we need so that we don't cause the rest of the UI to hang.

So let's fathom our project : you and I are building an image editor that happens all client-side. We are tasked with building the filter side of it, so users can adjust brightness, saturation, sepia-tone, contract, and blur.

> We're going to have to simulate jank as we're going to use CSS instead of actual image processing, and the browser is too good at applying CSS ðŸ˜…. But in reality if we were trying to actual image processing in the browser, jank would be a real concern.

You'll see a place where jank is frequently introduced - where we're talking user input and applying the values to UI elements. The browser measures so frequently that it becomes an issue.

The other thing we want: if you have a fast device, we want it to render more frequently, and if you have an old device (or low battery!) want it to render way less frequently. This is _very_ hard to do without hooking into React itself to accomplish.
