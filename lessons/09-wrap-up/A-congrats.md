üéâ You did it! üéâ

Congrats, this is a lot of info all at once, but you can call yourself well equipped to take on any problem with React, server-side or not!

So where do you go from here? Well, here's some fun ideas:

- Take your favorite app here (maybe the Next.js one) and deploy it to a service. [Vercel][vercel] is particularly well equipped for Next.js apps
- Take your database to the cloud! I'm obviously biased towards [Neon][neon] but any cloud database will work. I actually manage the integration between Vercel and Neon!
- Add more features to your note passing app.
  - Add real auth. [Neon Auth][auth] or [Clerk][clerk] would be two great options so you can actually have real users.
  - Make it into more of a Twitter feed so you can follow people and post general notes, not just direct messages.
  - Add an admin feature that allows the teacher to remove or edit notes.
  - Use something like Llama locally or Claude/ChatGPT to add a summary ability so you feed in all of a user's notes and get back a summary of the notes they've received

Let me know what you build! Tweet/post at me on [ùïè][x] or [Bluesky][bs]!

Thank you and go build cool shit!
